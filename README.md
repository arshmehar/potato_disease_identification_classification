# Potato_disease_identification_classification
This repository presents an advanced deep learning solution tailored for the precise identification of potato diseases. Employing cutting-edge convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of potato plant images, encompassing various diseases.


## Key Features:
1. Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a robust CNN architecture for high-precision disease classification.
2. Dataset: A curated dataset of diverse potato plant images, annotated with disease labels.
3. Training Pipeline: Clear and reproducible code for model training, including data preprocessing and augmentation.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Detailed analysis of model performance using standard metrics like accuracy and precision.
5. Inference: Deploy the trained model for real-time or batch inference on new potato plant images


## Motivation:

Late blight causes dark spots on potato leaves, while healthy leaves look green and clean.  Early blight, another common disease, shows as brown spots with concentric rings.
It's important for farmers to spot these differences quickly because addressing issues early can protect their crops and ensure a good harvest. Identifying and addressing these diseases promptly can save crops from damage.
