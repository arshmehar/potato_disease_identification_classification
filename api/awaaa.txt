The topic at hand states that leading groups should step down from their positions in any given field after five years as it provides invigorating, new lead and hence ensures success. When a new cohort is brought to power, they the the will to prove that they belong and refreshing new ideas which could essentially benefit any running system in the long run and hence I agree with the topic.

Let us take governance for an example. If a leader stays in power for too long, they might get too comfortable in their position, especially if it is not even being questioned and such a situation can often lead to tyrrany or dictatorship. Without being challenged in their position, even with having best interest of their public in mind how could a ruling party realize that changes should be made in their outmoded ways .

In the education sector, we notice that there is barely any change in the methods with which children are provided knowledge. Same classrooms filled abundantly with as many students possible , same black board education. Vey few institutions have started to incorporate technological enhancements which provide visuals and are way better especially considering today's generation with limited focus span. My school principal used to loathe technological devices because it keeps us away from the "real world". Although, her side was not completely wrong what I think she failed to understand was how advanced devices can also be utilized in the best interest. I also remember spending hours on playing a game which taught "how to code" with the help of games.


To conclude I would like to state that even though experience matters a lot, what matters even more is to be at pace with today's culture and trends and try to inculcate new measures which can surely be ensured promising a new group to power in a fixed time.
